# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection from MRI

This project uses **Deep Learning (CNN)** and **Flask** to detect brain tumors from MRI images.  
It helps in classifying MRI scans into **tumor** and **non-tumor** categories with high accuracy.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload MRI images through a simple web interface  
- Preprocessing of MRI scans (resizing, normalization, augmentation)  
- CNN-based classification using **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Accuracy and loss visualization using **Matplotlib**  
- Flask-based web deployment for real-time prediction  

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib  
- **Database (optional):** SQLite/MySQL

## 🧠 Model Overview
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on MRI datasets containing brain tumor images.  
It performs feature extraction and classification to identify tumor presence in new MRI inputs.

Model Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing (resize, normalize)
2. CNN Model Training (Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense)
3. Model Evaluation (accuracy and loss metrics)
4. Flask Integration for real-time web predictions
